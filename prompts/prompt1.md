i need to clarify all , it is too messy.
i want to achieve this:
1. remove any attribute but person in event log (no priority, no doc quality, no department or any other), apart from case id, activity, timestamp, just person ). as this is deeply included in the logic, check thoroughly and remove this from event log data , data generator and ui interface logic.
2. the options in the right click context menu must be just this: 
2.1.decouple by person/undo decouple by person (if it was decoupled before), and these just when in the clicked node the task has this person attribute with data, and decouple just that node, not following nodes as it does now. 
2.2 also, include the option of collapse (that will collapse all the following transitions from that node) 
2.3 and another of expanse all, that do that, expanse all the following nodes and transition (without decoupling)
3. when a node is the last one in the path, it must be shown visually, marking it in grey and not changing when hovering over it, as happens in the rest of the nodes, also, there are not context menu options for coherence. and include a label showing total time, total number of processes reaching that state.
4. the transition information label must be improved. right now it shows the number of processes and when hovering, mean and p (dont know what it is). I want to show this more clearly, something simple and easy to interpet like (#10/15d) and the information of the person, if that transition has decoupling, in other line with a person icon , his name and line in a color scale that represents time proportion. this way, the thicknes of the transition is proportional to the number and the color to the time. use log scale or something similar to keep thing visually attractive and not too exagerated (the way it is done now for transition arrow thickness is fine).
5. the states names (node names) need a conversion table to show a more gentle name, not the event log name, that is: not INFO_REQUEST but somethinh more easy to understand to the user "Request Info to applicant", but keeping text length under control to not do too big nodes.
6. change interface visuals according to @prompts/visuals.md
7. screen distribution, include a title in the top with a simple process description , then a legend at the bottom explaining how to use , very clean ans easy not too much text, minimal text., and then the diagram. all vertical.
8. include a panel for the user to select the top 6 variants by percentage of ocurrence. the panel should be in the diagram panel area, perhaps at the top right, occupying the vertical space between the start node and the first one, that always will be vacant. I must show each variant as a button that can be pressed by the user and change the diagram to show that flow complete (without decoupling). The user can always change it with the context menus , but once original variant diagram is changes, the button must be unpressed, just keep it shown as pressed while the diagram is not changed. The buttons must be very subtle. the app usage logic is, at start, show the most common variant button pressed and shown in the diagram, then let the user inspect manually with context menu and left click (which expand current node, that does not change from what is done now), and let the user come back to any variant pressing that variant button.
make a plan to get all this, and update phase2 file to adapt to this removing previous plan.
dont code yet, just think hard about the best way and order to get all this and explain to me.
then we will go step by step changing the current code and project.
